# EDA-for-FitBit-Dataset-

Here we need to build a regression model to predict the calories burnt based on the given training data. For a given dataset the necessary EDA steps followed from Understand the dataset with their datatypes to treating the outliers. The cleaned data is fed to any regression machine learning algorithm to predict the calories burnt.
